## What is the app about?

Portfolio site to inform and showcase some of my work.

## Main technologies I used in the app:

- React
- Typescript / Javascript
- Next.js
- Sass / Bootstrap / React-Bootstrap
- Netlify
- PWA
- Docker
- Etc...

## Some key points about the app:

- I created the site myself, meaning no template was bought except for the use of next.js setup.
- Mobile first approach, design ranging `320px-1600px`.
- Contact form setup
- Etc...

#### Feel free to contact me if you want to know more about me or the app. Thanks
